%% Assumptions
%  - Robot poses are facing along the X axis (horizontal, to the right in 2D)
%  - The robot moves 2 meters each step
%  - The robot is on a grid, moving 2 meters each step

%% Create the graph (defined in pose2SLAM.h, derived from NonlinearFactorGraph)
graph = NonlinearFactorGraph;

%% Add a Gaussian prior on pose x_1
priorMean = Pose2(0.0, 0.0, 0.0); % prior mean is at origin
priorNoise = noiseModel.Diagonal.Sigmas([0.3; 0.3; 0.1]); % 30cm std on x,y, 0.1 rad on theta
graph.add(PriorFactorPose2(1, priorMean, priorNoise)); % add directly to graph

%% Add two odometry factors
odometry = Pose2(2.0, 0.0, 0.0); % create a measurement for both factors (the same in this case)
odometryNoise = noiseModel.Diagonal.Sigmas([0.2; 0.2; 0.1]); % 20cm std on x,y, 0.1 rad on theta
graph.add(BetweenFactorPose2(1, 2, odometry, odometryNoise));
graph.add(BetweenFactorPose2(2, 3, odometry, odometryNoise));

%% print
graph.print(sprintf('\nFactor graph:\n'));

%% Initialize to noisy points
initialEstimate = Values;
initialEstimate.insert(1, Pose2(0.5, 0.0, 0.2));
initialEstimate.insert(2, Pose2(2.3, 0.1,-0.2));
initialEstimate.insert(3, Pose2(4.1, 0.1, 0.1));
initialEstimate.print(sprintf('\nInitial estimate:\n  '));

%% Optimize using Levenberg-Marquardt optimization with an ordering from colamd
optimizer = LevenbergMarquardtOptimizer(graph, initialEstimate);
result = optimizer.optimizeSafely();
result.print(sprintf('\nFinal result:\n  '));

%% Plot trajectory and covariance ellipses

hold on;
